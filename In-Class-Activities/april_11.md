- Disk Storage
- Cache Memory
- RAM


2. Which of the following developments has been a key factor in the evolution of microprocessors over the last several decades?

- Increasing the clock speed
- Adding more cores
- Improving energy efficiency
- All of the above


3. Virtual memory is a feature of operating systems that allows for:

-  Expansion of physical memory onto a hard disk or SSD.
-  Direct data transfer between disk storage and CPU registers.
-  Elimination of the need for RAM.
-  Increased processing speed by bypassing cache memory.


4. How have shifts in hardware technology over the years affected database management systems (DBM- ?

-  Led to a preference for disk-based storage over in-memory databases.
-  Reduced the need for data indexing and optimization.
-  Enabled more complex queries and real-time analytics through in-memory computing.
-  Decreased database reliability and increased data loss risks.

5. Which of the following best describes the principle of locality in the context of memory hierarchy?

-  Frequently accessed data is less likely to be stored in cache memory.
-  Data is evenly distributed across different types of storage media to speed up access.
-  Programs tend to access data that is either spatially or temporally near other recently accessed data.
-  The fastest storage devices are always utilized first for data storage needs.

6. Solid State Drives (SSD-  are preferred over Hard Disk Drives (HDDs) for certain applications due to:

-  SSDs have larger storage capacities.
-  SSDs have no moving parts, resulting in faster data access and increased durability.
-  Data can only be written to an SSD once.
-  SSDs are cheaper than HDDs.

7. The transition from single-core to multi-core processors in microprocessors was primarily motivated by:

-  The physical limits encountered in increasing clock speed.
-  The decreasing cost of manufacturing.
-  The demand for smaller computing devices.
-  The ease of programming for multi-core processors.


8. Moore's Law, which has driven advancements in microprocessor technology, predicts that:

-  The speed of microprocessors doubles every two years.
-  The cost of microprocessors is halved every two years.
-  The number of transistors on a microprocessor doubles approximately every two years.
-  The energy efficiency of microprocessors doubles every five years.

9. The primary function of virtual memory is to:

-  Increase the physical memory available on a system.
-  Allow programs to execute directly from disk storage.
-  Provide an illusion of a large, contiguous block of memory to programs.
-  Speed up CPU operations by reducing the need for registers.

10. In a computer system, the movement of data from disk storage to memory to CPU registers is primarily managed by:

-  The CPU exclusively.
-  The operating system's kernel.
-  The application software.
-  The disk storage firmware.


11. Which of the following is a consequence of increased RAM capacities for database management systems?

-  Decreased database performance due to higher memory consumption.
-  The ability to store entire databases in-memory for faster access.
-  Increased reliance on disk storage for data persistence.


12. The significant increase in network speeds over recent years has led to which of the following phenomena in the context of data centers and data management systems?

-  It has become slower to access data stored in the cloud compared to local storage devices.
-  The need for physical data storage on local devices has increased to compensate for network speed limitations.
-  It is often faster to access another computerâ€™s memory in a data center than to access data on a local disk.
-  Data management systems have become less reliant on network infrastructure for performance optimization.
